So, I know I have a long road ahead of me and I’m willing to work very hard to get back to where I was before. I want to thank all of you for all of your support and your wishes and prayers for my surgery, I really do appreciate it. God bless you all.” The Olympic Gold Medalist had previously announced in April that he was going to be having major surgery on his podcast, “The Kurt Angle Show.” “I’m having my knees replaced next month,” Angle said. “Both of them at the same time, I’m getting it over with. I’ll be on a wheelchair or a walker.” Angle has used his podcast in the past to speak about his injury history in WWE. He once revealed the worst two injuries he’s ever suffered, the failed table spot at SummerSlam 2000 that caused him to have a severe concussion and the chair shot from Brock Lesnar that broke his neck. “The chair shot that Brock gave me that broke my neck or this the concussion,” Angle said. “Those two were the worst injuries I’ve had in pro wrestling.” The Wrestling Mob Family would like to wish Kurt Angle a speedy recovery.

The audience was only down 0.23% from last week, despite facing strong competition from the NBA and NHL playoffs, while last week’s show did not have strong sports competition. “RAW” ranked #2 for the night on cable in the 18-49 demographic with a 0.41 rating, behind the NHL playoffs. In all of television, it ranked #9 for the night in the demo. The “Cody Countdown” did not seem to help the rating as it had the prior two weeks. The hour 1 to hour 3 audience drop was 17%, the biggest since April 18th. The 18-49 rating drop from hour 1 to hour 3 was 11.6%. Year over year, the audience was actually up 7%, while the 18-49 rating was down 9%. Last year, “RAW” faced competition from the NBA playoffs as well, however it was earlier in the post-season. The NBA game that opposed “RAW” the same week last year averaged 2.417 million viewers, while the game that opposed the majority of “RAW” last night averaged 6.397 million viewers.

The two women supposedly walked out just before “WWE Raw” last week, despite having a major role in the planned main event match. The company responded by stripping them of their titles and is set to host a tournament to crown new champions in the near future. In the days since, several major names in wrestling having come out in support for Banks and Naomi, including Mickie James and CM Punk, but Booker T is not among them. “I just think the situation should have been handled differently,” he said. “If they wanted to go out and get the job done, and then walk out and say, ‘Hey look, whatever you’ve got planned for us going forward we’ve got to talk about it,’ or, ‘We’re not in for it,’ I get that. But to up and leave the show, for anybody to support that … it’s setting a precedent as far as guys wanting to walk out and leave the show.” Neither Banks nor Naomi has commented publicly on the situation, but that hasn’t stopped the story from taking numerous twists and turns over the past week, from WWE’s original statement and various punitive actions to reports of creative disagreements to speculation on whether or not the whole thing is a work. Booker T, for his part, says he’s “leaning toward it’s not,” but also wishes the incident hadn’t been amplified as much as it has. “I just think this whole situation could have been avoided in front of the media,” he said. “I do think all of this being in the media is just blowing it up to a proportion to where we’re looking at it like, we’re like hanging on the edge, wondering what’s going to happen next.” “What happens next” is indeed the question everyone is asking, especially given that Banks’ and Naomi’s WWE contracts are reportedly set to expire soon. Speculation is running rampant that the pair are on their way to All Elite Wrestling, and that WWE might freeze their deals to prevent their defection to AEW. After all, with the rise of another major televised wrestling company for the first time since WCW’s demise, there is now another place for wrestlers to make money, and many former superstars have turned down WWE contracts in favor of its competitor. Adam Cole, Bryan Danielson, Keith Lee, Ruby Soho, and many other former WWE stars are now part of the AEW roster — but as Booker points out, there are no guarantees. “To be thinking about these guys from a perspective now where they can just jump up and just do anything because AEW is over there, and they can run over there and get a job, well AEW ain’t hiring everybody, okay,” he said. “I’m not saying that they won’t hire Naomi and Sasha, but I’m just saying they’re not hiring everybody. There’s a lot of people out there right now in this wrestling world that don’t have jobs, and AEW easily could have signed them.” ","date":"2022-05-24","objectID":"/brooker-t-speaks-on-sasha-banks-and-naomi-walk-out/:0:0","tags":["WWE News"],"title":"Booker-T Speaks on Sasha Banks and Naomi Walk Out","uri":"/brooker-t-speaks-on-sasha-banks-and-naomi-walk-out/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Photo Credit: 2k and WWE\" Photo Credit: 2k and WWE Cody Rhodes, founder and former star of All Elite Wrestling, made his return to WWE at WrestleMania 38. While many were expecting Rhodes to be back after his business relationship with AEW had seemingly deteriorated, it’s unlikely that anyone foresaw him being a late addition to “WWE 2K22.” Rhodes never did make it into the game, but according to SportsGamersOnline.com, it wasn’t for lack of trying. SGO reported last week that WWE was in talks with Take-Two Interactive, which is the parent company for “2K” series developer Visual Concepts, to bring the American Nightmare into the game as downloadable content after he returned. Since the company knew Rhodes would be coming back in February, they wanted to get him back in time to do a special DLC package for the character after WrestleMania. The report cites “a person close to the developmental team,” who claimed that “WWE tried, but it was quickly shot down.” “They knew it was unlikely,” the source continued, “but you don’t know for sure unless you ask.” The report also stated that given all the detail that goes into creating characters, there simply wasn’t enough time to add Rhodes to the game, especially since the game’s entrance announcements are performed by Greg Hamilton, who had already been released from the company. For now, unfortunately, “WWE 2K22” users will have to rely on their own community creations version of Rhodes if they want to play as the American Nightmare. Cody’s last appearance in a WWE game came in 2016 for “WWE 2K17,” in which he was playable as Stardust. WWE has been rumored to be in talks with Electronic Arts (EA) over the rights to the WWE Games division of the company, looking to add themselves to one of the top gaming publishers in the world. The recent installment of “WWE 2K” was viewed as a make-or-break project with a lot riding on its success.

The show is said to be covering his entire career, from starting in 1983 to when he wrestled his last match with WWE at Royal Rumble 2012 to becoming the General Manager of “Raw” until 2019. While speaking to Sports Illustrated’s Justin Barrasso, Foley had this to say about his new show. “I know the way I feel when I hear a good podcast, how it can turn a whole day around and put a smile on my face,” Foley mentioned. “I’m looking forward to telling stories and reminding people of a time they really enjoyed when they were big wrestling fans.” ","date":"2022-05-24","objectID":"/mick-foley-new-podcast-release-date-confirmed/:0:0","tags":["WWE News"],"title":"Mick Foley New Podcast Release Date Confirmed","uri":"/mick-foley-new-podcast-release-date-confirmed/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Photo Credit: WWE\" Photo Credit: WWE At age 24, Theory (fka Austin Theory) has established himself as one of the fastest-rising superstars in WWE, and a lot of thanks for that goes to his selfie game. The current WWE United States Champion has been carrying around an iPhone since he got back to the main roster, taking selfies after defeating his opponents, or just to capture a particular moment in time. “We’re definitely over a thousand I would say,” Theory said during a recent guest appearance on 95 KGGO. “I would say my proudest one would have to be the selfie with Mr. McMahon when I won the United States Championship.” That’s a title Theory still holds, and he has a few ideas about personalizing it. Over the years, several WWE superstars have had their own custom championship belts, from Steve Austin’s “Smoking Skull” championship to Daniel Bryan’s “Eco-Friendly” belt, and of course, John Cena’s spinner championship design, which was applied first to the United States title and then to the WWE Championship. “I definitely would have something that’s more flashy,” Theory stated. “I love the spinner titles, I think they’re great. I don’t know, maybe there’s a way to incorporate a camera or something on there, you know, take a selfie with the title. Imagine you lay somebody out, and then you hold the title up, and it’s just taking a picture of them on the ground. How cool is that?” Theory debuted on “WWE NXT” in 2019 and was first called up the main roster in 2020, challenging for the “Raw” Tag Team Championship with Angel Garza at Wrestlemania 36 and briefly joining a stable led by Andrade before becoming a disciple of Seth Rollins. That summer, however, he was moved back to “NXT” — possibly due to an accusation of inappropriate conduct leveled against him by a 13-year-old girl at the height of the #SpeakingOut movement — where he joined Johnny Gargano’s stable, The Way. After another year in “NXT,” Theory was drafted to Monday Night Raw in October 2021, after which he attacked Jeff Hardy and took a selfie with him after the match. “What’s really cool is when I was in ‘NXT,’ I actually tried a selfie idea with Tyler Breeze,” Theory said. “I don’t think that’s the reason we did it [on the main roster], but it was cool that I tried that, and then when I got to ‘Raw’ there was this idea of me just knocking out Jeff Hardy and taking a selfie and I was like, ‘Wow, this sounds like the best thing in the world.’” ","date":"2022-05-24","objectID":"/theory-has-unique-idea-for-custom-us-championship/:0:0","tags":["WWE News"],"title":"Theory Has Unique Idea for Custom Us Championship","uri":"/theory-has-unique-idea-for-custom-us-championship/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Photo Credit: AEW\" Photo Credit: AEW Recently, AEW’s Jake Roberts gave a worrying update regarding the health of Ricky Steamboat, one that turned out to be misleading after Steamboat revealed he was doing just fine. On the latest episode of the “DDP Snake Pit” podcast, Roberts attempted to clear the air regarding what he’d previously said. “Last week we were talking about someone who I hold in the highest regard. Nobody higher,” Roberts said. “And I value our friendship as I do Dallas’. He’s just a lovely, lovely man. And last week, out of concern, I brought up something that I had no business bringing up because I didn’t check who said it. Number one, you should never talk about someone unless you’ve checked the facts. I said that I’d heard Ricky was having problems with the mental aspect. I did it out of concern and love and fear, fear that I’d been the reason may be that he was having problems.” DDP Snake Pit co-host DDP, Diamond Dallas Page, then also chimed in with an update of his own on Steamboat. “He looks like a million bucks,” DDP said. “I spent time with him and it’s like, ‘The son of a b—h can get in there and still go.’” Roberts then continued to try and make right for his mistake and expressed worry over what this could mean for his friendship with Steamboat. “I repeated something I heard from what I thought was a very good source,” Roberts said. “Someone that spends time with him. I was totally wrong in doing it. I’m ashamed that I did it. I am so scared that I’m going to lose my friendship with him. I’ve reached out with no luck. And Ricky, I certainly understand you have the right to ream my butt, kick my butt. Just don’t shut the door on our friendship.
