Lacey Evans is scheduled to make her return to the ring for the first time in over a year on next weekâ€™s WWE Raw.

As of this writing, no opponent has been announced for Evans.

Evans last wrestled back on the February 15, 2021 episode of Raw, when she teamed with Peyton Royce in a match against Asuka and Charlotte Flair. Evans then went on maternity leave shortly thereafter. she gave birth to her second child last October.

A series of vignettes leading up to her in-ring return, began airing during SmackDown this past April. In the series of videos that aired, Evans told her real-life story, and had been presented as a full babyface.

Evans then re-debuted during the May 6 episode of Friday Night SmackDown, and appeared to be a heel. After a vignette with Evans was shown during the May 9 episode of Raw, it was reported WWE moved her to the Raw brand.
